# seo-codex

Master SEO via Codex.

## Getting started
- Open `MASTER_INDEX.md` for a high-level overview of every domain in the Codex and where to find specific assets.
- Use `INDEX.md` inside the repository to jump directly to Gospel, Tag System, Loader, Metadata, and Workflow documents.
- Need a blank scaffold? Use `DROP_INTO_CODEX_STRUCTURE.md` to recreate the full folder tree with stub files before importing into a new Codex workspace.

## Version history
See `version-history.md` for a chronological log of Codex updates.
