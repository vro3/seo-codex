**Title:** Internal Linking System
**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Standardize how tag hubs and show pages link together for SEO and UX.

## Tag Hub Structure
* Each tag acts as a topic cluster anchored by `/filtered-shows?tag={tag}`.
* Shows attach to 5–12 tags each to reinforce relevance across hubs.
* Tag hubs should cross-link horizontally (related tags) and vertically (child/parent tags when used).

## Contextual Linking Map
* Cross-link related shows inside body copy and CTA blocks.
* Use clear anchor text that reflects the show or tag name.
* Include suggested acts and navigation flows that guide users to booking.

## Show Page Linking Rules
* Above the fold: include at least one internal link to a tag hub and one to a related show.
* Footer: repeat tag links plus a “Related Shows” module specifically tuned for SEO relevance.
* Tag lists must render as clickable, SEO-friendly links that mirror the 301 map.

## Anchor Page Strategy
* Maintain cornerstone pages for top categories (Corporate Entertainment, LED Drumming, Interactive Experiences, etc.).
* Anchor pages should link out to the strongest shows and tag hubs and receive links back from those pages.
* Refresh anchor pages when new shows launch or when tags change to keep topical authority strong.
