**Title:** Tagging Rules
**Version:** 1.1
**Purpose:** Ensure all tags follow a consistent logic.

* Tags describe the **type** of show, not the vibe.
* Use simple, lowercase, hyphenated tags pulled from the Tag Registry.
* Every show must have 5–12 tags to fuel tag hubs and internal linking.
* Tags must match the 301 mapping list.
* Avoid tag duplication or near-duplicates.
* All tags must be relevant to the buyer (corporate, live-music, AI, drums, DJ, LED, interactive).
