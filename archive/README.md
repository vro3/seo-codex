**Archive Directory**

**Purpose:** Store deprecated versions of Codex documents.

Usage:

* Move superseded loaders, sheet specs, or other retired documents here.
* Preserve filenames with version suffixes for traceability (e.g., `universal-show-loader-v1.4.md`).
* Document moves in `version-history.md` when archiving files.
